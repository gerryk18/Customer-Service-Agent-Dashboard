# Customer Service Agent-Dashboard
While working for PP I was tasked with creating an agent dashboard that would track KPI's and metrics for Customer Service Agents in the call centre. This dashboard was then broadcast onto screens in the office.

I build it using R and Shiny. The Shiny Dashboard referenced .rds files that queried API's from the call centre phone and messaging software.

Each rds file grabbed a different KPI, for example:

* Current Load
* Opened and Closed Conversations
* NPS - Net Promoter Score
* SLA - Service Level Agreement
* FTR - First Time Response

The Tableau dashboard uses data from the following sources:
